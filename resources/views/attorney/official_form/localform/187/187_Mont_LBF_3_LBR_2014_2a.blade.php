            {{ __('Chapter 7 gives debtors important benefits, such as the opportunity to obtain a discharge of
            most debts - but Chapter 7 also puts burdens on debtors, such as the burden of making complete
            and truthful disclosures of their financial situation. It is important for debtors who file a Chapter 7
            bankruptcy case to understand their rights and responsibilities in bankruptcy. In this connection, the
            advice of an attorney is crucial. Debtors are entitled to expect certain services will be performed by
            their attorneys, but debtors also have responsibilities to their attorneys. In order to assure that
            debtors and their attorneys understand their rights and responsibilities in the Chapter 7 process, the
            Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana has approved the following agreement, setting out
            the rights and responsibilities of both debtors in Chapter 7 and their attorneys. By signing this
            agreement, debtors and their attorneys accept these responsibilities.') }}
