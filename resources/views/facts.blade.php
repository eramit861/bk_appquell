<h3><b>Why BK Questionnaire’s software is unique?</b></h3>
<p>
Our software was developed by a bankruptcy paralegal with over 14 years of experience, not an attorney and/or software engineer. The reason that’s important is in most law firms, the support staff are getting the questionnaires, documents and handling the questions from clients. The software your currently using was developed by software developers and corporate attorneys. This is the most important difference. How can you create a great software system that actually works and is efficient, you’re not on the ground floor, in the trenches or even in the game? The other bankruptcy software companies don’t have 14 years of boots on the ground experience. That’s why the biggest bankruptcy software company is still selling 1980’s technology for a crazy amount of money. Our software uses today’s best technology for today’s bankruptcy clients and law firms. You can’t make your law firm 2022 efficient with 1980’s tech. See how were different below.

<h3><i>Our software is designed to be used from any mobile, tablet or desktop device:</i></h3>
<p>
This allows your client to fill out the questionnaire and upload the requested documents (with professional quality scans) from anywhere, they don’t have to be sitting at home on their desktop computer. In todays on the go society this will make getting the required documents a lot easier. Most of us are on our phones and tablets most of the time anyways and we all understand how to navigate our mobile devices better than a computer.
</p>
</div>

<div class="trm-section-class">
<h3><i>Step-by-step videos that walk your client through the questionnaire and on how to scan professional quality documents into the system from their mobile or tablet device:</i></h3>
<p>
This helps in getting more accurate information as well as more information filled out in the questionnaire as well as the requested documents as anybody can follow simple video instructions on how to take a picture and allow their phone or tablets software to do the rest.
</p>
</div>

<div class="trm-section-class">
<h3><i>Our system has two things that make a massive difference in getting the questionnaire filled out and ALL the requested documents:</i></h3>
<ol>
<li>Our system reads your clients documents and auto-populates it into the questionnaire. (For example, it reads the monthly payment from their mortgage statement and populates it into their expenses, means test and the statement of financial affairs.)</li>
<li>Your client can screen shot any question they don’t understand even after the explanation on the step-by-step video and send it over free chat in the app to you and your office can explain it so they fill it out properly.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="trm-section-class">
<h3><i>Our questionnaire adapts to each client, so it only asks for relevant information to be filled out:</i></h3>
<p>This ensures we get the most amount of relevant data from each client. Each client is only going to spend so much time filling out the information you need to prepare their bankruptcy case. Our software doesn’t waste part of that time on information that doesn’t apply to each individual client. Most questionnaires if not all require the client to adapt to it, by having the client decide what does and doesn’t apply and/or asking for the same information in multiple places. Our software does the opposite, it gets the most out of the client by adapting to the individual client. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="trm-section-class">
<h3><i>Branded as your own software free</i></h3>
<p>You can upload your law firm or company logo into the system. Your client will only see your logo on the website and apps.</p>

<h3>
<strong>Why BK Questionnaire’s software fixes the top 3 problems in bankruptcy with its software:
</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Getting Client Documents:</strong></br><p>Clients can scan and upload documents from any mobile or tablet device as well as a desktop scanner; Our software reads the data needed in the uploaded documents to auto populate most of the client questionnaire; This gives the client a benefit and/or incentive to upload all the requested documents into the system (less work for the client) and results in more accurate information and documentation for you the attorney; Scanning and uploading documents is easy convenient and free, not every client has a scanner or the funds to go the local store and have them professionally scanned for $20.00 to $30.00 to send you. If you have clients dropping off paperwork at your office, you still need all the information from the documents and you must sort through all the documents to find what you need and what you don’t need. Then you still need to input it all into whatever software system you use. With our system even if, you have your client come in to drop off the documents, you can log into the system from their app and scan in all their documents for them, then hand them back to your client so you don’t have to store them or make copies before they go at your expense.
    </p></li>

    <li><strong>Completed Questionnaire:</strong><br><p>The step-by-step video tutorials help the client fill out the information needed. It walks them through the questionnaire step-by-step, “It’s like the client took your assistant home with them to help in accurately completing the questionnaire”; Our questionnaire adapts to each client, so it only asks for relevant information to be filled out; Our system is mobile based so it can be done on the go, the client doesn’t have to sit at home. They can also screen shot any questions and send them to you via free chat through the apps and or website.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Data entry from client documents and questionnaire into the bankruptcy petition: (Auto populate/ Data merge)</strong></br><p>Our system reads the client data and auto populates it into the client questionnaire to reduce time for the client to filling out the questionnaire. The client is just mainly reviewing and editing information to make sure its accurate. Our system auto populates the entire petition (except for exemptions) from the client questionnaire, or you can download the client questionnaire in a CSV file that uploads into some of the most popular petition preparation software’s.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><b>How does BK Questionnaire software benefit my law firm?</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>It reduces time spent by your support staff in getting documentation and information from the client. It dramatically reduces requesting the same documents and/or information repeatedly.</li>
    <li>Our step-by-step tutorial videos walk your client through the questionnaire. Imagine if your legal assistant sat down with each client and they step by step went through the entire questionnaire and document needed, wouldn’t you get a lot better questionnaires and documents than you’re getting now?</li>
    <li>If you have your legal assistant going over every questionnaire and document now with your client this will almost eliminate all that extra time and cost to your law firm.</li>
    <li>By giving clients an incentive to scan the documents needed into the system, you get two things: more accurate and complete information and documents.</li>
    <li>This reduces the data entry time significantly for you and your clients. No other system does that.</li>
    <li>You might find another system that does auto populate the petition but, when you only get 15%, 20%, or 60% of the information needed to prepare a case how much time is auto populating really saving you or is it even cost effective.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="trm-section-class">
<h3><b>Why choose BK Assistant over the competition?</b></h3>
<p>Besides our software being more comprehensive than any other options out there right now. We want to have the best solutions to truly maximize your law firms time and costs. Our paralegals still prepare petitions and work with clients, so we can be up to date and innovate better than any other company. We welcome feedback such as: comments, suggestions, criticisms, and opinions.
